<h3>
Accessing rPi without SD card adapter </h3>
<h5>June 13, 2018</h5>

<h5>Purpose:</h5>
Just get it connected

<h5>What I did: </h5>
PoA 1: Connnect directly via ethernet to laptop:
Issues: Did not know previously set static IP for raspberry Pi
Repercussion: Could not set my local adapter to be on the same network as the Pi
Workarounds: tried using AngryIp Scanner to test current adapter setting (169.---.---.---) and failed to work. Tried some various other IPs without any real method and decided this was not the way to go.  

<br>
<br>

PoA 2: Connect through router (worked)
Issues: already knew this works and was emotionally defeating :(
Actions: Connected rPi to router directly with ethernet cable, then from laptop accessed router setup page to see IP or rPi. Then connected using Putty.

<br>
<br>

What I should do next:
Identify the Static IP so I can connect to it regardless from anywhere using ethernet to laptop. Will have note here regarding IP.
